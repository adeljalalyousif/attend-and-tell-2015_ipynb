# Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate

An implementation of the model described in the paper. The summarization of the paper can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/uzi0espil/research-papers-implementation/wiki/Neural-Machine-Translation-By-Jointly-Learning-to-Align-and-Translate).

## Run

Please first make sure you have the requirement libraries installed.

~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

Then run the notebook `run.ipynb`.

For experimenting, you can control the model's parameters by configuring `config.json` file, feel free to modify it based on your device's capabilities.
