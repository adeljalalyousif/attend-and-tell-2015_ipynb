# Introduction

An implementation of the techinque described in [Conditional Generative Adversarial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) Network paper with different model architectures and methods. The notes of the paper and other related methods can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/uzi0espil/research-papers-implementation/wiki/Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Network). The experiment is tested on two datasets, namely, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10.

# Run

First install the required libraries:

~~~shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
