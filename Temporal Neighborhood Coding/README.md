# Introduction

An implementation for the framework described in [Unsupervised Representation Learning For Time Series With Temporal Neighborhood Coding](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8qDwejCuCN) Trained on HAR V1 Dataset. The notes of the paper and other related methods can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/uzi0espil/research-papers-implementation/wiki/Temporal-Neighborhood-Coding).

# Run

First install the required libraries:

~~~shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
~~~

Then, play with `run.ipynb`. The experiment and model paramaters can be controlled from `config.json`.
